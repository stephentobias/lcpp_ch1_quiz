# Learncpp Chapter 1 Quiz 

This is a program written as my response to the Chapter 1 quiz, question #3: 
> Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, and then enter a second number. The program should tell the user what the result of adding and subtracting the two numbers is.
> The output of the program should match the following (assuming inputs of 6 and 4):
> 
> ```
> Enter an integer: 6
> Enter another integer: 4
> 6 + 4 is 10.
> 6 - 4 is 2.
> ```
> Hint: To print a period and a newline, use ".\n", not '.\n'.
